# Styler
Make Neural Net, paint for you!
Styler is a deep learning tool, in which style of one image is applied on style of another image!
#### It is based on transfer learning, and it is implementation of the research paper ["Image Style Transfer by CNN"](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)

I experimented it on Taj Mahal, and I'm attacing the styled version of it, that is output from the pretrained vgg19 after moulding it according to the paper.

# Result!
### Final Image, One that vgg19 painted!
